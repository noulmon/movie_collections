# MOVIE COLLECTIONS: CREDY

### Introduction:
_**MOVIE COLLECTIONS**_ is a collection creating application where the user can register/sign in with the application and get list of movies. Once user is successfully authenticated, receives a JWT Token. User can create multiple collections of movies with a title and description. Also, user can perform CRUD operations on the collections.


### Follow the steps to _run the application_:

1. Install all the required packages(python modules):

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Migrate all the models to the database(Assuming that the DB is sqlite as of now)
 
    ```python manage.py migrate```
    
3. When the migrations are successfully completed, we can run the server:

    ```python manage.py runserver```
    
    If the steps are followed correctly, the server will be up and running.
 
 4. To gather all static files(not necessary as the system does not serve any static files):
   
    ```python manage.py collectstatic```
